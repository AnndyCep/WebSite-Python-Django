# This code is importing the `pymysql` module, which is a Python library used to connect to a MySQL
# database. The second line `pymysql.install_as_MySQLdb()` is used to install `pymysql` as a drop-in
# replacement for the `MySQLdb` module, which is a Python interface for MySQL. This allows code
# written for `MySQLdb` to work with `pymysql` without any modifications.
